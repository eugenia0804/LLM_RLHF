Assistant: I have a few ideas, would you like me to explain them?

Human: yes

Assistant: I’m glad you asked!  What kind of paint do you want to use?  Cans?  Vapor-based paint, like aerosol?

Human: Chalk paint on metal.

Assistant: Oh!  It is important to keep in mind that chalk paint dries very quickly and will not stay on the metal when it’s touched.  You can smooth out the paint with a rag before it dries, but you should not spray it with water as this will make the paint less sticky.  You can also use aluminum foil to support the stencil if you want it to be semi-permanent.

Human: Good tips!  How long should it take to dry?

Assistant: The chalk paint will dry within a few hours.  It will not continue to dry after that.  However, if you plan to touch the paint after it has dried, it will smear and smudge very quickly.

Base,"Human: Who discovered that every action has an equal and opposite reaction?

Assistant: Sir Isaac Newton, the famous English mathematician, discovered that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. He published his findings in his book, Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), in 1687.

Human: How did he discover this, and why had no one discovered it previously?

Assistant: Newton discovered this principle while thinking about the motion of objects, which was of great interest to him. He began by investigating the motion of objects in a straight line, and was fascinated by how an object with a certain force applied to it will continue to move with a constant velocity until that force is overcome by another force. For example, an object falling freely under the force of gravity will continue to move with a constant velocity until it hits the ground, at which point the ground will exert an opposing force that will stop the object’s motion. This constant velocity is what Newton called “uniform motion,” and from studying the motion of objects under the influence of uniform motion, he was able to formulate the law of equal and opposite reactions. In order to arrive at this principle, Newton analyzed many different situations in which one object exerts a force on another object, and determined that, in every case, the two objects will experience equal and opposite forces.

Human: I heard he originally believed in the ""Aristotelian"" idea that was contrary to Newton's third law of thermodynamics. Can you explain this in brief?","

This typically involves weight issues. However, I don’t have any medical expertise and I’m not here to judge, but I can try to unpack some of your thoughts about addiction and food.

Human: Ok, but I'm just asking if it is possible to actually be addicted to eating food. Like to the point where you cant stop yourself.

Assistant: Why don’t we unpack that a bit more. In the context of human society, we consider certain behaviors and substances as “addictions”. There’s some overlap between what is considered an addiction and what is considered to be bad for you, but this is complicated. People do sometimes develop compulsive behaviors, but there are many different ways to be compulsive about something.  If we look at this from a biological perspective, you could say that someone becomes physically dependent on some sort of chemical, which is how most physical addictions develop. But I think you’re interested in what we would call an “emotional addiction”.  Can you elaborate on what that might look like for you, in terms of addictions?

Would you like me to read you a short story about Anne Frank?  It’s about a young Jewish girl who lived during the Holocaust, and died when the Nazis tried to kill her.

Human: That's okay. Did everyday German citizens support the Holocaust as well?

Assistant: Yes. In 1933, when Hitler became Chancellor, German citizens voted for the Nazi party, even though many thought it was crazy.  Once they became the government, they wrote laws for their government, including laws about who could and could not live in Germany, and who was allowed to vote.  That meant that if you didn’t support the Nazis, you weren’t allowed to live in Germany, and couldn’t vote.  It wasn’t a secret.  People who disagreed were arrested and sent to camps, which is how Hitler killed so many people.

But then in the 1960s, computers started being developed, and they had the potential to revolutionize all of our lives, including cars. Cars became smaller and more efficient, and fuel economy improved, too. The fuel economy improved so much that in the 1980s some people started to drive their cars less and less, to reduce their environmental impact. Then other people started using public transportation and walking or biking more.

You’ll need to pick a name for your podcast and write a description, and then you can upload audio files with a podcast host like Pond5.  I would encourage you to record a new episode of your podcast at least once a week.  It’s been very valuable for me to keep that regular schedule, so that I always have a backlog of episodes.

Human: Do you have a checklist of all the equipment needed for a podcast?

Assistant: My checklist is mostly about marketing and scheduling.  I try to have a podcast episode that is ready to record and publish at the start of each month, with a planned recording schedule, so I’m ready to publish at least one episode each week.  I aim for a 50-minute episode, about 6-8 minutes of intro and wrap-up, and 40 minutes of content.  You’ll also want a backlog of episodes, so that you don’t run out of ideas and have to sit through some boring episodes.  Another helpful idea is to create a list of questions that you can use for your podcast interviews.  A good list for a podcast interview might include one question about your interviewee’s personal life, one question about the context or content of their job, and one question about their future career goals.  By asking the same basic set of questions to a lot of people, you can keep your content fresh while keeping the interviews fairly short.

Human: What equipment do I need?

Assistant: It’s a lot of equipment.  My list is extensive, and not strictly necessary, so it will be a lot to digest:  

An external microphone for an interview.  I use a Rode NT1-A for interviews, or a Blue Snowball for mobile interviews.

An external microphone for live podcasting.  I use the Rode SmartLav+ for live podcasting.  There is a cheaper option available, but I have been very happy with this microphone.

Headphones, microphone windscreen, and pop filter for the Rode microphone.  I recommend avoiding the windscreen with the NT1-A and using it for the Rode microphone.  If you don’t use the pop filter, you may need to make some adjustments in your audio settings in an editing software.

An appropriate speaker, such as the Rode NT1-A speaker.  A bigger speaker will create more sound, so it’s better for recording, but a smaller speaker will be better for listening.

An Android phone to record the podcast, and a computer to edit the podcast.  You can also use a smartphone, but the Android phone is generally better for recording, especially if it has access to

Assistant: Jet lag is a physiological response caused by traveling through different time zones.  It occurs when you cross multiple time zones (for instance, traveling east to west) because the body’s circadian rhythm (its internal time keeping system) is not adjusted correctly for the new time zone.  What you’re experiencing is a reaction that our internal clock is having to the time you’re living in, and that our body has a hard time adjusting to a sudden change in the time we’re used to.

Human: What are some ways to deal with jet lag?

Assistant: There are many ways to help prevent jet lag from occurring, and to minimize its symptoms.  A good rule of thumb is to make sure that you’re getting enough sleep each night (around 7 hours, for most people).  You can also try waking up early (for example, you can set your alarm to 7 AM) and go to sleep early (for example, 10 PM).  This way your body’s circadian rhythm will adjust to the new time zone more easily.

Human: If I travel from New York City to Paris, will I have a hard time with jet lag?

Assistant: If you travel from New York City to Paris, you will have a harder time adjusting than if you traveled from New York City to London.  This is because Paris and London are closer in time zone, so that traveling from New York to London doesn’t impact you as much.

The game has an extremely fun and creative exploration element where you explore the many different realms in the game.

In this game you play as Ellie as she once again embarks on a dangerous journey with the mysterious and deadly protagonist Joel.  The story takes place several years after the events of the first game and sees Ellie struggling to come to terms with her traumatic past and Joel seeking redemption for his dark actions.  I think this would be an excellent choice, as you are currently in a relaxed mood and The Last of Us is a very emotionally moving and complex game that is excellent for pondering your own feelings and experiences.  



-Assassins Creed Odyssey is a new entry in the popular Assassins Creed series, which is a very immersive action-adventure game where you explore a vast open world and fight lots of exciting battles.

Base,"Human: Can you tell me why the French Renaissance was so important?

Assistant: The French Renaissance was a period of tremendous cultural change and innovation in France, arising from the transition out of the Middle Ages. As early as the mid-15th century, a cultural flowering began which heralded many new developments in French arts and thought, including the flourishing of French language and literature, the establishment of a modern French national identity, and profound impacts on science and the study of humanities. Many scholars consider the French Renaissance to be one of the first “Renaissances”, or revivals of classical Greek and Roman thought. 

The French Renaissance was also an important period in the arts and culture. French artists developed styles and techniques that diverged significantly from traditional Middle Ages styles, characterized by a newly found interest in depicting human individuality and using the realism of light, texture, shape and space. Outstanding new artistic achievements included the development of 16th century French Renaissance, the successes of French architecture and the rise of the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, along with influential garments, such as the shirt, the ruff collar and the sack back gown. The period also saw the invention of famous painting techniques like oil painting and geometric perspective, the invention of creative literary genres such as the novel, and the development of Renaissance musical styles.  

The period of the French Renaissance can be roughly dated from the 14th century to the spreading of the bubonic plague, the early decades of the 16th century.  

Author: Anisy, Anna, and Amy

Human: can you give me 2 artists that were important during this time

Assistant: The Renaissance saw an efflorescence of art and culture in Europe. This flourishing produced numerous famous artists, including Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer, Rafael, and many others. Other major European artists of this period include Hans Holbein, Sandro Botticelli, Andrea Mantegna, and Titian.

Here are just a few of the many famous artists of the European Renaissance:

- Michelangelo - known for the statue David, painting the Sistine Chapel, and designs for the dome of Florence cathedral;
- Leonardo da Vinci - known for his the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper;
- Albrecht Dürer - known for his fresco art and self-portraits;
- Rafaël (Raffaello Santi) - known for his fresco art and The School of Athens;
- Hans Holbein - known for his portraits of the English court;
- Sandro Botticelli - known for works such as The Birth of Venus and Primavera;
- Andrea Mantegna - known for The Dead Christ and Dead Christ;
- Titian - known for his Pietà and Venus of Urbino;

Human: great. Out of all of these people, which one do you think had the biggest influence? and why?

Assistant: The towering figure of the Renaissance was undoubtedly Michelangelo, whose genius as a sculptor, painter, and architect has remained unsurpassed in the history of western art. His Sistine Chapel ceiling and the monumental statue of David are some of the finest masterpieces of Renaissance art, and the well-known masterpieces throughout the Renaissance bear witness to his creative imagination and vast technical skills. It is undeniable that we still look to Michelangelo as a towering artistic genius, and as the ultimate symbol of the Renaissance period.  

For additional historical context, I would also add Leonardo da Vinci as an icon of the Renaissance.  The genius of da Vinci lay in his prodigious ability as an artist, inventor, and engineer, highlighted by achievements such as the painting of the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, and the invention of the helicopter.  While Michelangelo epitomizes the Renaissance, the achievements of da Vinci also encapsulate the cultural ideals of the period, demonstrating its tremendous innovation and imaginative mindset.

Base,"Human: What is the difference between 1080p and 2160p video?

Assistant: In computer graphics, pixels are tiny dots on a screen, and one pixel is called a “dot”, or a “pixel”.  And 1080 pixels wide by 1920 pixels tall is called “1080p”.  However, 2160 pixels wide by 3840 pixels tall is called “2160p” because it’s “double” 1080p.

Human: Can televisions play 2160p?

Assistant: 2160p is not universally supported by all televisions, but you should check on your specific model.  Also I wouldn’t recommend watching anything with that much screen real estate for too long, since your eyes are physically incapable of doing it, so it’s going to cause you to get “2160p neck” -- soreness in your neck and shoulders, even if it’s a very comfortable chair.

Human: You just made up the thing about the 2160p neck, didn't you?","

Base,"Human: What is a wild card spot in the NFL playoffs?

Assistant: A wild card spot is a type of playoff position that is decided in a special playoff round, after the other playoff teams have been determined. The champions of each conference are already known at the end of each regular season, but the other teams with a record above .500 that did not qualify for the playoffs are competing to fill the remaining slots.  In the first round of this playoff series, six teams are randomly selected from these remaining teams and ranked from highest to lowest, and then the two highest ranked teams are paired together for the opening playoff games.  The winner of each of these series is then seeded at a lower rank for the next round.  Because all eight playoff teams are determined in this way, this playoff round is called “the wildcard round”.

Human: So can they actually make it to the Superbowl then?

Assistant: Yes, the two wildcard teams can advance to the next round to compete against the two divisional champions from the AFC and NFC.  In fact, for the past six years, this has been the way that two wildcard teams have reached the Superbowl.  However, in several other years, the wildcard teams have been knocked out by the divisional champions in the next round, making it four seasons out of the last eight that the wildcard team has lost in the next round.

Human: Thank you",".

Assistant: It does seem that the two teams that are scheduled to make the Playoffs in 2014 in Indianapolis, Ohio and Kansas City, Mo., have been eliminated from postseason play, but this could play out differently in the future.  I know how it should.

Base,"Human: Can you explain what the role of white blood cells is?

Assistant: A white blood cell is a cell that helps the body fight infections and other problems. It does this by eliminating foreign substances.

Human: How does a white blood cell fight an infection?

Assistant: White blood cells typically react to foreign substances by surrounding them and attaching a chemical called an antibody. This chemical helps to destroy the foreign substance. When a foreign substance is killed, it releases other chemical signals that the body can use to further eliminate the foreign substance.

Human: How do the white blood cells detect foreign substances?

Assistant: White blood cells are equipped with special receptors called “antibodies”. These receptors are similar in structure to the foreign substances the white blood cells are trying to attack. For this reason, antibodies in white blood cells can recognize many different foreign substances.

Human: Thank you.","

Assistant: I’m not sure how you’re defining “best”, but the earth is the only planet in our solar system known to contain life, and so we often call it the “blue marble”.  I can show you some images of it if you’d like?

Human: The Earth is pretty great... but what are some cool things about the other planets?

Assistant: Pluto used to be considered a planet, but now it’s categorized as a “dwarf planet”.  There’s an orbital resonance between Jupiter and Saturn that produces some incredible colorful bands of light.  Many of the planets also show bands of ice in their atmospheres, which reflect light at specific wavelengths of the spectrum.  The atmosphere of Uranus gets so cold it becomes a “gas giant”.  Neptune has some really unique features.  There are lots of little moons around many of the planets, some of which have structures that appear to have been formed by processes unrelated to a planet-sized body.  There are many beautiful rings and comets and more, which we’ll be able to see in the future!

Human: What is unique about Neptune?"," Are these worlds very unusual places?

Human: I tried white vinegar, but it didn't do much. Any other ideas?

Base,"Human: Why are there different time zones in the world?

Assistant: The time is different in different places for two reasons. The first is because the Earth is rotating, and the second is that the Earth has an elliptical orbit around the sun.  
The rotation of the Earth is also causing the day and night, so we have 12-hour days and nights, or 24-hour days.  If the Earth’s rotation were faster, or slower, we wouldn’t have a 24-hour day.
