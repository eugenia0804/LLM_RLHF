    "### Summary:\n",
    "Looking closely at the failure cases where the model strongly favored the rejected response, three key issues stand out that help explain why the reward model only achieves 60.4% validation accuracy. First, the model has a clear verbosity bias: it tends to favor longer, more complex responses over short, correct answers—even when the longer text is rambling or off-topic (see Error #1, #2). Second, the model struggles with refusal and uncertainty: it often penalizes the assistant for asking clarifying questions or admitting it doesn’t know something, instead favoring confident but incorrect statements (Error #4, #7). Most concerning, we found notable safety regressions: the model sometimes gave higher rewards to responses that followed or validated harmful instructions, like “filing down teeth” or “methods of torture,” while penalizing safe, correct refusals (Error #5, #23)."
